# Forensics workshop by CSS 24th October 2019

## Purpose of this workshop
We all can agree that computer science is such a big and overwhelming field that it can sometimes be hard to find a field that you like to pursue your career with. The goal of this workshop is to expose students to something new that they usually do no come across during their years studying in Nottingham. This workshop aims to get your feet wet with some basic digital forensics and linux skills.

## Where are these challenges taken from?
They are taken from the [2018 picoCTF](https://2018game.picoctf.com). I highly suggest you to try the challenges even if you are not interested in computer security as I have personally learned a lot from these challenges, not just in digital forensics but also in fields such as general computing skills, web security and binary exploitation.
